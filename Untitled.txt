Test the connection to ensure that the JDBC driver and authentication DLL are correctly configured.
Example Maven Dependency Configuration (for Reference)
If you prefer to use Maven for dependency management, ensure that you have the correct dependencies specified in your pom.xml file:

xml

Copy
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>mssql-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>8.2.0.jre8</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
    <artifactId>mssql-jdbc_auth</artifactId>
    <version>8.2.0</version>
    <classifier>x64</classifier>
</dependency>
However, DBeaver itself may not directly utilize Maven for resolving these dependencies, hence the manual steps above.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully configure DBeaver to use the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver and the associated authentication DLL. If you continue to encounter issues, double-check the paths and ensure you are using the correct versions of the driver files.
